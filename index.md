# My Mission

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my goals. My dream for the small island nation and the Caribbean on a whole that we can at the forefront of technology and theory. Not waiting on, grabbing onto the laurels of, larger nations to provide us with services for when the time comes they will not forsake thier own to provide for us. If not I but someone I teach or anyone the initiative brings motivation and inspires a brighter future.
